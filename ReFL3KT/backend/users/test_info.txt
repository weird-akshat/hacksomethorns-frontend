Feature tested: Creating and retrieving users via the API
Type of test: API/Backend test (Django REST Framework APITestCase)
Test file path: backend/users/tests.py

Instructions to run the test:
1. Make sure you have Django and Django REST Framework installed.
2. From your project root, run:

   python manage.py test users

This will execute the following tests:
- test_create_user_success: Verifies that a user can be created using the API and that the returned data is correct
- test_create_user_password_mismatch: Verifies that password confirmation validation works correctly
- test_create_user_duplicate_username: Verifies that duplicate usernames are rejected
- test_create_user_missing_required_fields: Verifies that required fields are enforced
- test_get_user_details_success: Verifies that user details can be retrieved by ID
- test_get_user_details_not_found: Verifies that non-existent users return 404
- test_get_user_details_invalid_id: Verifies that invalid user IDs are handled properly

The tests verify both the POST /api/create/ endpoint for user creation and the GET /api/<user_id>/ endpoint for user retrieval.
