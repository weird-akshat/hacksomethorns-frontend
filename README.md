# ReFL3KT - Frictionless Productivity Solution for Students

## Project Description

ReFL3KT is a seamless productivity and goal-tracking platform designed for students. It integrates time tracking, goal setting (with hierarchy and group features), journaling, and analytics into a unified, intuitive workflow. AI-driven prioritization, gamified LUBE points, and minimal manual input ensure students can focus on growth, not admin tasks. The mobile-first approach ensures accessibility and engagement, while group goals and community features foster accountability and collaboration.

### **Explanation**

- **Mobile App (Flutter):**  
  Students interact with a user-friendly mobile interface to log time, set goals, journal, and view analytics.

- **API Layer (Django REST API):**  
  The app communicates with the backend via RESTful API endpoints. This layer handles authentication, request validation, and routes requests to the appropriate modules.

- **Core Modules:**
    - **User Management:** Handles authentication, registration, and user profiles.
    - **Time Tracking:** Manages time entries, categories, and integrates with goals.
    - **Goal Tracking:** Supports hierarchical and group goals, progress, streaks, and LUBE points.
    - **Journal:** Stores and retrieves daily reflections and logs.
    - **Analytics & AI Recommendations:** Processes data to generate productivity insights, dynamic scheduling, and personalized recommendations.
    - **Group Goals:** Manages collaborative goal setting and progress tracking.

- **Database (PostgreSQL):**  
  All modules interact with a centralized PostgreSQL database, which stores structured data such as users, time entries, categories, goals, journals, analytics, and group goal information.

**This modular backend ensures seamless integration of time tracking, goal management, journaling, and analytics, enabling frictionless productivity and personalized recommendations for students.**
