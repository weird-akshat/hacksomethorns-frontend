yoo, best of luck for your presentation (not that i am hoping for any brownie points or actual points from this, but if you want to, who am i to deny right?)
  
TLDR
Briefly explain what export/share feature you've added: PDF for bar chart and pie chart.
Mention where in the app it can be accessed: in the category report page in the mobile app.
List which files/components were changed or added for this feature: ReFL3KT/frontend/lib/time_tracking/time_tracking_analysis/pages/category_detailed_analytics.dart


                                         
coming back to point
export feature: pdf of the bar chart and doughnut chart (previously a pie chart that's why you'll see pie in the variable names).
the doughut chart shows the comparison betweeen different time tracking entries, showcasing how much time you spent on each unique entry (within a chosen timeframe).
the bar chart shows the time spent on that category for each day (given that you made a time entry for that category that day).

alright i think i should explain what a time entry is, so that it doesn't get confusing 
time entry is essentially a block of time, it has start time, end time, description, category. It is used to keep track of what you were doing at what time essentially.

now let's say the category is studying 
the bar chart will show how much time you spent on studying each day (for a given time period)
the pie chart will show the percentage of various descriptions for that category during that time. here time entries could be subjects you need to study. 

enough yapping ig
you'll find the components that changed are in category_detailed_analytics.dart in (ReFL3KT/frontend/lib/time_tracking/time_tracking_analysis/pages/category_detailed_analytics.dart ofc pubsec.yaml lmao.

if you want to see the dependencies they are there in the pubsec.yaml (all the dependendencies starting with fusion)
