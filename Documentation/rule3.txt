Animations: 
1. Added splash screen
For this, i added animated_splash_screen in the pubspec.yaml file, and modified the main.dart file in order to display the splash screen
There are two different splash screens, one for light mode and one for dark mode

2. Analytics  screen
Added animation into the analytics.dart file through the use of AnimationController in the analytics.dart file.
The animation works in such a way that the pie chart building and row building finish in the same time, with the rows having the animation of swiping from bottom to top.

3. App Logo
Added a custom app logo
Added flutter_launch_icons into the pubspec.yaml file, and ran the code once so that the custom image becomes the default app icon.
